## What is ChaiBizkit?

ChaiBizkit is an initiative for all the small and medium businesses running in a city.
We aim to bring these businesses together and glue them with the power of modern technology.
This will bridge the gap they face between the new-age e-commerce platforms and the traditional business models.

## Why "_ChaiBizkit_"?

Because great businesses happen over a cup of steaming tea and some crunchy biscuits to dip them in.

Our goal is to provide a platform where businesses can some together and make wonders!
